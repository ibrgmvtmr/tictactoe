## ðŸ’¾ Save System

### Save file location:
The game saves progress to a plain text file named **`save.txt`** in the root directory.

### Save file format:
The save file is a plain text file with the following structure:
<size> <row1> <row2> <row3> ... ```
<size>: A single number representing the board size (e.g., 3 for a 3x3 board).

<rowX>: Each subsequent line represents one row of the board.

X and O indicate player moves.

A period (.) represents an empty cell.
