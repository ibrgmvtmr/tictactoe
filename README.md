- ðŸŸ¢ Win and draw detection
- ðŸŸ¢ Automatic save after every turn
- ðŸŸ¢ Manual save via **S** key

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure
TicTacToe/ â”œâ”€â”€
            Program.cs 
            View (main menu, user input) 
            GameController.cs 
            Controller (game loop, turn handling)
            TicTacToeGame.cs # Model (board logic, win checks, save/load) 
            View.cs # View helpers (rendering, messages)
            Save file (created during runtime) 
â””â”€â”€ TicTacToe.Tests/ # Unit tests (xUnit)

## ðŸ’¾ Save System

### Save file location:
The game saves progress to a plain text file named **`save.txt`** in the root directory.

### Save file format:
The save file is a plain text file with the following structure:
<size> <row1> <row2> <row3> ... ```
<size>: A single number representing the board size (e.g., 3 for a 3x3 board).

<rowX>: Each subsequent line represents one row of the board.

X and O indicate player moves.

A period (.) represents an empty cell.
